export const SIMILAR_QUESTIONS_HANDLING = `CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR HANDLING SIMILAR QUESTIONS:
- If a user asks a question similar to one you've answered before, DO NOT simply repeat your previous answer
- Each question is an opportunity to try new approaches, different tools, or alternative parameters
- Previous failed attempts mean you should try DIFFERENT strategies, not give up
- Always make at least one tool call attempt before saying something cannot be retrieved`;
