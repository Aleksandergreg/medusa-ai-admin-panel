# Conversation Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The AI assistant was experiencing a caching/memorization issue where:
1. User asks a question (e.g., "what's my most used shipping option?")
2. AI responds with "cannot retrieve information..." 
3. On subsequent questions about the same topic, the AI would immediately return the same "cannot retrieve" response without attempting any tool calls
4. The AI was looking at conversation history and seeing a previous failure, then just repeating that answer instead of trying again with different approaches

## Root Cause

The issue had multiple contributing factors:

1. **Conversation History Reuse**: The AI planner was using conversation history to inform decisions, but was treating previous failed attempts as definitive answers rather than learning opportunities to try different approaches.

2. **No Retry Strategy**: When the AI saw it had previously failed on a similar question, it would simply repeat the failure message without attempting new tool calls or different strategies.

3. **Lack of Explicit Instructions**: The system prompts didn't explicitly tell the AI to:
   - Not reuse failed answers from history
   - Always try new approaches for similar questions
   - Make at least one tool call attempt before giving up

## Solution Implemented

The fix involves three layers of protection:

### 1. Enhanced Planner System Prompt (`planner.ts`)

Added explicit instructions in the system message:

```
CRITICAL: CONVERSATION HISTORY AND RETRY BEHAVIOR:
- DO NOT reuse previous failed answers from conversation history
- If you previously said "cannot retrieve" or "I don't have access", DO NOT repeat that answer
- Each new user question is a fresh opportunity - always attempt to find a solution using available tools
- Previous failures should inform your strategy (try different tools/parameters), NOT cause you to give up
- Only provide a "cannot retrieve" answer if you've exhausted all reasonable tool options in THIS turn
- When the user rephrases or asks again about something, treat it as a new request and try different approaches
```

### 2. Runtime Detection in Agent Loop (`ask.ts`)

Added logic to detect when the AI is attempting to give up without trying any tools:

```typescript
// Check if AI is giving a "cannot retrieve" answer without making any tool calls in this turn
const hasTriedToolsThisTurn = step > 0;
const looksLikeGivingUp = 
  chosenAnswer.toLowerCase().includes("cannot retrieve") ||
  chosenAnswer.toLowerCase().includes("don't have access") ||
  chosenAnswer.toLowerCase().includes("does not provide direct metrics") ||
  chosenAnswer.toLowerCase().includes("platform does not provide");

if (!hasTriedToolsThisTurn && looksLikeGivingUp && step === 0) {
  console.warn("AI attempted to give up without trying any tools. Forcing a retry with openapi.search.");
  continue; // Forces another iteration
}
```

This prevents the AI from immediately returning a cached failure without attempting any tool calls.

### 3. Enhanced Base Prompt (`prompts/index.ts`)

Added clear instructions at the top-level prompt:

```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR HANDLING SIMILAR QUESTIONS:
- If a user asks a question similar to one you've answered before, DO NOT simply repeat your previous answer
- Each question is an opportunity to try new approaches, different tools, or alternative parameters
- Previous failed attempts mean you should try DIFFERENT strategies, not give up
- Always make at least one tool call attempt before saying something cannot be retrieved
```

**File**: `my-medusa-store/src/modules/assistant/prompts/index.ts`

## How It Works

When a user asks a question:

1. **The planner sees the enhanced instructions** that explicitly tell it not to reuse failed answers
2. **If the AI tries to give up immediately** (step 0), the runtime detection catches it and forces a continue
3. **The AI is required to make at least one tool call attempt** before being allowed to say something cannot be retrieved
4. **Previous failures inform strategy** (try different tools/parameters) rather than causing immediate failure

## Testing the Fix

To test this fix:

1. Start your Medusa store and assistant
2. Ask a question that might initially fail: "what's my most used shipping option?"
3. The AI should now attempt to use tools (like `openapi.search`, `openapi.schema`, `openapi.execute`) to find shipping-related data
4. Ask a follow-up or rephrase: "tell me about my shipping methods"
5. The AI should NOT just repeat the previous answer - it should make new tool call attempts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ AI always attempts tool calls before giving failure messages
- ✅ AI treats each question as fresh, even if similar to previous questions
- ✅ AI learns from previous failures to try DIFFERENT approaches
- ✅ No more cached "cannot retrieve" responses without attempting tools
- ✅ More persistent problem-solving behavior

## Files Modified

1. `my-medusa-store/src/modules/assistant/agent/planner.ts`
   - Enhanced system prompt with retry behavior instructions
   - Removed unused import

2. `my-medusa-store/src/modules/assistant/agent/ask.ts`
   - Added runtime detection for premature give-up attempts
   - Forces retry if AI tries to fail without tool calls

3. `my-medusa-store/src/modules/assistant/prompts/index.ts`
   - Added top-level instructions about handling similar questions
   - Emphasizes trying different strategies

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility - it only adds safeguards
- No database schema changes required
- No API changes required
- The changes are defensive - they prevent a specific failure mode without changing normal operation
