# 🔧 DEBUGGING GUIDE

## The Real Issue

Looking at your order data:

```json
{
  "payment_status": "captured",
  "fulfillment_status": "delivered" // ← This is the key!
}
```

When you ask **"how many delivered orders do I have?"**, the AI should search for:

```json
{
  "fulfillment_status": "delivered" // NOT "fulfilled"!
}
```

## Status Mapping in Medusa

### Fulfillment Status Flow

1. `not_fulfilled` → Order created but no fulfillment
2. `partially_fulfilled` → Some items fulfilled
3. `fulfilled` → All items fulfilled (packed/shipped)
4. `delivered` → Order delivered to customer

### The Problem

- Your orders have `fulfillment_status: "delivered"`
- But AI is searching for `fulfillment_status: "fulfilled"`
- These are **different states**!

## Testing Commands

Try these exact queries:

### ✅ This should work now:

```json
{
  "fulfillment_status": "delivered"
}
```

### ✅ Use the new dedicated tool:

```text
"Use delivered_orders_count tool"
```

### ✅ Check all status combinations:

```json
{
  "group_by_status": true
}
```

## Quick Verification

1. **Count delivered orders**: `{"fulfillment_status": "delivered"}`
2. **Count captured payments**: `{"payment_status": "captured"}`
3. **Count delivered + captured**: `{"payment_status": "captured", "fulfillment_status": "delivered"}`

The third query should give you the count of completed orders!
